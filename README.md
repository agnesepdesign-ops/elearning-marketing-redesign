- Teachable is focused more on content creation and conversion, the goal is to offer the best "self-school creation experience".
- Zoom one of the main player in "live and collanborating meetings".
- Moodle is useful to better understand how the LMS (leasrning management system) works using a widely used platform as reference.

- **More calls to action have been added within each section**, with the aim of guiding users as they navigate and making the path to action more intuitive and action-oriented.

- Strategic use of typography and color, redesigning primary, secondary and tertiary buttons folowing Aladia brand colors.
